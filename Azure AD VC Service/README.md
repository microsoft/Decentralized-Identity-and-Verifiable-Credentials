# Microsoft Verifiable Credential Service
Azure AD verifiable credentials service is currently in public preview. Microsoft is actively colloborating with members of [Decentralized Identity Foundation](https://identity.foundation/), the [W3C Credentials Community Group](https://www.w3.org/TR/did-core/), and the wider identity community to unlock a new set of experiences for users and organizations to control thier self-soverign identity (SSI).

## How does Microsoft Verifiable Credential Service works
To deliver Web of Trust model, Microsoft implemented following key components:

![image](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/media/decentralized-identifier-overview/microsoft-did-system.png)

* **Decentralized Repository** 
    * ION (Identity Overlay Network) is a Layer 2 open, permissionless network based on the purely deterministic Sidetree protocol, which requires no special tokens, trusted validators, or other consensus mechanisms; the linear progression of Bitcoin's time chain is all that's required for its operation
    * Microsoft manages thier own ION node
    * Microsoft [open sourced a npm package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@decentralized-identity/ion-tools) to make working with ION network easy to integrate into apps and services. The open source libraries include creating a new DID, generating keys, and anchoring DID on the Bitcoin blockchain
* **User Agent/Wallet**
   * Microsoft Authenticator App on both iOS and Andriod mobile platform is extended to support Decentralized Identities (DIDs) and Verifiable Credentials (VCs)
   * Authenticator creates DIDs, facilitates issuance and presentation requests for verifiable credentials and manages the backup of DID's seed through an encrypted wallet file
* **Microsoft Resolver**
   * Provides API that connects to Microsoft ION node to look up and resolve DIDs using the did:ion method and return the DID Document Object (DDO). he DDO includes DPKI metadata associated with the DID such as public keys and service endpoints
* **Azure Active Directory Verified Credential Service**
   * Provides an issuance and verification API and open-source SDK for W3C Verifiable Credentials that are signed with the did:ion method
   * It enables identity owners to generate, present, and verify claims which enables the trust between users of the systems

2. [The VC SDK for Node, on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/VerifiableCredentials-Verification-SDK-Typescript)
3. [An Android SDK for building decentralized identity wallets,on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/VerifiableCredential-SDK-Android)
4. [An iOS SKD for building decentralized identity wallets, on GitHub](https://github.com/microsoft/VerifiableCredential-SDK-iOS)

# Claim types supported by Microsoft Verifiable Credential Service

Currently the service supports four input types. These types are used by the verifiable credential issuing service to insert claims into a verifiable credential and attest to that information with DID. The four types are:

* **ID Token**
   *  Azure AD verifiable credential service can issue verifiable credentials by retrieving claims from an ID token generated by Issuer organization's OpenID compliant identity provider. 
   *  The article [Issuer service communication](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/active-directory/verifiable-credentials/issuer-openid) covers on how to set up an identity provider so Microsoft Authenticator can communicate with it and retrieve the correct ID Token to pass to the Issuing Service
   *  Authenticator authenticates the user using OpenID Connect authorization code flow
* **Verifiable credentials via a verifiable presentation**
   * In this flow, the user presents a verifiable credential in order to issue one by the issuer
   * The end result of the flow is the issuer receives the claims from the verifiable presentation presented by the user which are issued as verifiable credentials  
* **Self-Attested Claims**
   * It allows the user to directly type information into Authenticator
   * Issuer can validate the user externally and recieve the claims from any external data source including their custom applications, ERP systems or CRM systems, etc. 
* **Static claims**
   * Issuer defines a static claim which would look like any other claim in the Verifiable Credential
